        "content": "<h3>PRESS RELEASE<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>With tenancy deposits coming under fire recently, Eddie Hooker, CEO of Hamilton Fraser, parent company to mydeposits, looks at whether alternative insurance products, offering a deposit free solution, protect both landlords and tenants, and if they improve the Private Rented Sector (PRS).<\/p>\n<p>To address these questions and many more potential issues, mydeposits has today released a 14-page Whitepaper that reviews how these insurance products operate versus traditional cash tenancy deposits. You can read the Whitepaper in full <a href=\"https:\/\/66.155.76.202\/wp-content\/uploads\/Deposit-or-no-deposit-insurance-What-we-need-to-know-1.pdf\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When paying a deposit at the beginning of a tenancy, a tenant is presented with a fairly substantial cost &#8211; the equivalent of six weeks\u2019 or two month\u2019s rent. According to Eddie Hooker, a cheaper alternative would, of course, seem very appealing to many tenants. He says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>There are now several no deposit insurance products that offer a solution whereby a tenant can rent a property without having to put down a deposit. Despite the initial attraction, I have been unable to find clear answers to some pertinent questions. Landlords and tenants entering into such contracts should do so with their eyes wide open.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Tenancy Deposit Protection was introduced as a legal requirement in 2007 following government statistics which suggested that 20% of deposits were being unfairly withheld from tenants. Some ten years later, over four million individual deposits are protected by tenancy deposit protection schemes and dispute levels have fallen to less than 2% of all ending tenancies.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cThe no deposit products use the 2% dispute levels as proof that they can keep their claims and premiums low, but they are misusing the statistics. In fact, more than 40% of deposits are returned to the tenant with an agreed deduction. That means at least 40% of landlords will have to make a claim on their insurance to cover costs. Processing claims costs money and claim costs get added to the overall premium.\u201d <\/em>states Eddie.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Like most insurance products, the no deposit options reserve the right to subrogate their losses from the party responsible, so does that mean the tenant will be pursued for a claim that they may or may not be responsible for? Will tenants start to receive red letters, black lists and court judgements for missing payments?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Whitepaper also reviews how tenancy deposit protection has boosted transparency in the sector.<\/p>\n<p>Eddie continues: <em>\u201cThe Prescribed Information requirements and formal dispute resolution service are set in stone by legislation and are monitored by government set timescales. In complex deposit disputes which require an understanding of the Housing Law and Consumer and Agency Law, would landlords and tenants prefer an impartial adjudicator employed by a deposit scheme reviewing their case, or an insurance claims handling process? Disputes raised through deposit protection schemes are free and the process must be fair for both parties. The no deposit insurance products remove these safeguards leaving landlords and tenants to rely on the insurer\u2019s terms and conditions.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In the light of the Queen\u2019s Speech, where it was announced that deposits will be capped at no more than one month\u2019s rent, Eddie says: \u201c<em>Following this news, I question whether the no deposit products will be as interesting to tenants as they may have been. These products command a premium the equivalent to one weeks\u2019 rent. This will now equate to 20-25% of a deposit and is non-refundable, whilst also leaving a tenant liable for reimbursing the insurer for any claims they pay out. I struggle to see how this is a viable option for the hardest pressed tenants and is not just another fee they will have to pay.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Eddie concludes by reiterating that he can see the merits of an alternative to deposits, but believes the current crop fall foul of the most basic protection that tenancy deposit protection schemes were created to administer in the first place. \u201c<em>The Whitepaper goes some way in voicing my concerns. I do welcome change for the PRS and new products that make people\u2019s lives easier. However, the sector needs absolute transparency and fairness, particularly when tenancy deposit protection has been so successful in raising standards.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/66.155.76.202\/wp-content\/uploads\/Deposit-or-no-deposit-insurance-What-we-need-to-know-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7537\" src=\"https:\/\/66.155.76.202\/wp-content\/uploads\/Untitled-design-5-1.png\" width=\"348\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"http:\/\/66.155.76.202\/wp-content\/uploads\/Untitled-design-5-1.png 500w, http:\/\/66.155.76.202\/wp-content\/uploads\/Untitled-design-5-1-150x150.png 150w, http:\/\/66.155.76.202\/wp-content\/uploads\/Untitled-design-5-1-300x300.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 85vw, 348px\" \/><\/a>-ENDS-<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For further information, please contact:<\/p>\n<p>Helen Evison, The Inhouse Way PR, t: 01276 804411, m: 07920516577<\/p>\n<p>Holly Addinall, The Inhouse Way PR, t: 01276 804411, m: 07979537334<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOTES TO EDITORS:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Hamilton Fraser:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based in Borehamwood and now employing 180 people, Hamilton Fraser provides specialist insurance and scheme administrator services throughout the UK and abroad.<br \/>\n<strong><em>About mydeposits:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>mydeposits is the trading name of Tenancy Deposit Solutions Limited, a company jointly owned by the National Landlords Association and HFIS plc T\/A Hamilton Fraser Insurance (the Scheme Administrator) to deliver custodial and insurance-based tenancy deposit protection scheme under contract from Communities &amp; Local Government.<\/li>\n<li>mydeposits aims to support landlords and agents to comply with the legislation and provide everyone with the confidence that deposit money is protected for the duration of the tenancy.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Landlords and letting agents wishing to use this scheme are required to register with the Scheme Administrator.

You can read the Whitepaper in full here.\r\n\r\nWhen paying a deposit at the beginning of a tenancy, a tenant is presented with a fairly substantial cost - the equivalent of six weeks\u2019 or two month\u2019s rent. According to Eddie Hooker, a cheaper alternative would, of course, seem very appealing to many tenants. He says:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are now several no deposit insurance products that offer a solution whereby a tenant can rent a property without having to put down a deposit. Despite the initial attraction, I have been unable to find clear answers to some pertinent questions. Landlords and tenants entering into such contracts should do so with their eyes wide open.\r\n\r\nTenancy Deposit Protection was introduced as a legal requirement in 2007 following government statistics which suggested that 20% of deposits were being unfairly withheld from tenants. Some ten years later, over four million individual deposits are protected by tenancy deposit protection schemes and dispute levels have fallen to less than 2% of all ending tenancies.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe no deposit products use the 2% dispute levels as proof that they can keep their claims and premiums low, but they are misusing the statistics. In fact, more than 40% of deposits are returned to the tenant with an agreed deduction. That means at least 40% of landlords will have to make a claim on their insurance to cover costs. Processing claims costs money and claim costs get added to the overall premium.\u201d states Eddie.\r\n\r\n\"Like most insurance products, the no deposit options reserve the right to subrogate their losses from the party responsible, so does that mean the tenant will be pursued for a claim that they may or may not be responsible for? Will tenants start to receive red letters, black lists and court judgements for missing payments?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Whitepaper also reviews how tenancy deposit protection has boosted transparency in the sector.\r\n\r\nEddie continues: \u201cThe Prescribed Information requirements and formal dispute resolution service are set in stone by legislation and are monitored by government set timescales. In complex deposit disputes which require an understanding of the Housing Law and Consumer and Agency Law, would landlords and tenants prefer an impartial adjudicator employed by a deposit scheme reviewing their case, or an insurance claims handling process? Disputes raised through deposit protection schemes are free and the process must be fair for both parties. The no deposit insurance products remove these safeguards leaving landlords and tenants to rely on the insurer\u2019s terms and conditions.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the light of the Queen\u2019s Speech, where it was announced that deposits will be capped at no more than one month\u2019s rent, Eddie says: \u201cFollowing this news, I question whether the no deposit products will be as interesting to tenants as they may have been. These products command a premium the equivalent to one weeks\u2019 rent. This will now equate to 20-25% of a deposit and is non-refundable, whilst also leaving a tenant liable for reimbursing the insurer for any claims they pay out. I struggle to see how this is a viable option for the hardest pressed tenants and is not just another fee they will have to pay.\u201d\r\n\r\nEddie concludes by reiterating that he can see the merits of an alternative to deposits, but believes the current crop fall foul of the most basic protection that tenancy deposit protection schemes were created to administer in the first place. \u201cThe Whitepaper goes some way in voicing my concerns. I do welcome change for the PRS and new products that make people\u2019s lives easier.

Self-managing landlords and agents also need to comply and obtain a licence after completing a relevant training course and passing a \u2018fit and proper\u2019 assessment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #009cb3;\">Rent Smart Wales have released the following statement:<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A Newport landlord has been fined \u00a34,400 for operating a dangerous, unlicensed house in multiple occupation and failing to comply with Rent Smart Wales.<\/p>\n<p>Robert Ivor Grovell of Tram Lane, Llanfrechfa, Cwmbran is the first landlord in Wales to be prosecuted for failing to become licensed with Rent Smart Wales, a Welsh Government scheme, which is helping to drive up standards in the private rented sector.<\/p>\n<p>Rent Smart Wales requires private landlords to register and managing landlords and agents to become licensed with the scheme. Since November 23, 2016, landlords and agents who fail to comply with Rent Smart Wales are breaking the law.<\/p>\n<p>Mr Grovell was prosecuted under Section 7(5) of the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 at Newport Magistrates Court for his non-compliance. The offence was one of a number brought against him by Newport City Council for housing-related offences at a property on Orchard Street in Newport to which Mr Grovell pleaded guilty. An inspection of the property by Environmental Health officers in December 2016 uncovered serious problems with the design and layout of the property and an escape route blocked with furniture and other items, both of which could have been fatal to tenants in the event of a fire. In addition, the property was occupied as a house in multiple occupation but Mr Grovell had failed to apply for the necessary licence from Newport City Council. Rent Smart Wales checks identified that Mr Grovell was registered but not licensed, even though he was carrying out management activities at the property. Since the inspection, he has completed the required Rent Smart Wales training and submitted his application for a license.<\/p>\n<p>Bethan Jones, Operational Manager of Rent Smart Wales at Cardiff Council, the single licensing authority for the whole of Wales, said:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cThis case is a real milestone for Rent Smart Wales, being the first prosecution of a non-compliant landlord. \u201cThis prosecution sends a strong message to other non-compliant landlords who continue to flout the law and those who haven\u2019t complied should come forward now to avoid action against them\u201d.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In total, Mr Grovell was fined \u00a34,400 and ordered to pay \u00a31,000 costs and victim surcharge of \u00a3170.<\/p>\n<p>Councillor Ray Truman, Cabinet Member for Licensing and Regulation at Newport City Council praised officers for their dedication in bringing such a prosecution to court.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cThis was a serious breach of regulations covering a house in multiple occupation where the residents were put at risk because of the landlord\u2019s failure to comply with essential regulations aimed at keeping people safe in their home. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This court case should also remind landlords of the need to license houses in multiple occupation. Failing to do so could end up with an unlimited fine being imposed by the court<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Newport City Council will continue to be vigilant in ensuring landlords and agents stick to the rules covering their rental properties.

            "ev_short_description": ["Damage to your property is a big problem as a landlord and can lead to insurance claims. There are two main caused of damage, malicious or accidental. It is, therefore, important to know the differences between the two in order to get the right cover from your insurer. Not having adequate cover can leave you with a nasty bill.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat is malicious damage?\r\nMalicious damage is damage caused by either your tenant or their guests intentionally to the rented property. This covers anyone who is lawfully allowed to be on your property.\r\n\r\nMalicious damage could include smashed windows, doors or furniture, arson in the property, and graffiti on property walls or furniture.\r\n\r\nFor malicious damage to be covered by an insurer you must be able to prove that the damage was caused with intent and that it\u2019s been reported to the police. This means you\u2019ll need to provide a crime reference number and police station details.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat is accidental damage?\r\nAccidents can happen. Accidental damage is unintentional and usually occurs suddenly, and can include physical damage and\/or loss of function.\r\n\r\nAccidental damage could include a ball being kicked through the window, a nail hammered through a water pipe, or falling through the ceiling when in the attic.\r\n\r\nThere are certain exclusions not usually covered by accidental damage, these include:\r\n\r\n \tFair wear and tear\r\n \tPet damage\r\n \tDefective design or workmanship\r\n \tContents damage\r\n \tDamage caused by building works\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nCan you claim from a deposit for damages in the property? \r\nIt is not only insurance cover that you need to be aware of when malicious or accidental damage occurs in a property.\r\n\r\nIf your property is not returned in the same condition as that at the beginning of the tenancy, and there is evidence of malicious or accidental damage, then you may be entitled to make deductions from the tenant\u2019s deposit. These deductions should always be fair and reasonable and you must allow for fair wear and tear in the property which does not qualify for a deduction of the deposit.\r\n\r\nIn mydeposits experience, cleaning, damage and redecoration are the most common causes of dispute between a tenant and landlord.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWho is liable for the damage? \r\nEven though malicious and accidental damage to your building has been caused by tenants it will fall to you, the landlord, to pay for any repairs. It is, therefore, vital you have comprehensive insurance cover.\r\n\r\nAssociate director at Total Landlord Insurance, Steve Barnes, explains the importance of having malicious and accidental damage cover included within your policy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhilst your deposit could cover some of the damage in the event of malicious damage by the tenant or their guests, the likelihood is that the damage will be several times the deposit you have taken.\r\n\r\nMost insurance policies will include malicious damage as standard but many will exclude this cover if it has been caused by the actual tenant or any of his guests. It is important to check that your policy gives you adequate protection. At Total Landlord Insurance, we cover malicious damage by the tenants or guest subject to the tenant passing a full reference check and we are offering a free limited time online service for this by visiting www.totaltenantreferencing.co.uk.\r\n\r\nPlease call our expert advisors to discuss our covers and policy limits on 0800 63 43 880.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to claim for damages\/redecoration read our dispute insight guide here."],

Myself and a team made our way there for the day\u2019s events.\r\n\r\narla|propertymark boast that this was the largest conference they had ever held and in my view there was no mis-description here. Every seat was filled, indeed a sell-out. Given the political events surrounding the industry at the moment, I was frankly not surprised that so many flocked to this gathering especially as the agenda for the day promised to be eventful.\r\nThe main event\r\nWhat do you think dominated proceedings? Yes you have guessed it - the proposal to ban letting agent fees to tenants. This long standing debate has finally crystalised with the current Government\u2019s proposal to legislate on this issue and to follow Scotland with a prohibition enshrined in statute. Various statistics were presented on the impact of this change and the effect it will have on rents, agent\u2019s incomes and jobs and whether landlords would exit the market, flooding it with former buy-to- let properties. The arla|propertymark MD David Cox excoriated the Government as being heavy handed and out of touch with the sector and the effects their proposition would have. The pejoratives continued in a panel debate where David and a leading letting agent were pitted against a FT Journalist and Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town, a Labour Peer.\r\n\r\nFrom a neutral perspective, both sides made very valid points and the other member of the panel a civil servant from the ministry, clearly encouraged as many people as possible to feed into the consultation period. Whilst the conference was left with no doubt the ban would happen the how, when and the fine detail were all up for discussion and the industry should be as deeply involved as possible.\r\n\r\nThe current Housing Minister was notable by his absence but delegates were shown a recorded message predominantly focusing on the fees issue.\r\n\r\nUp to now, ARLA have been very bullish in their language and approach to the announcement and that in my view was the right thing for a trade body to do and their members should expect no less.\r\n\r\nThe Fair Fees Forum now presents a vehicle for presenting the industry perspective on the implementation of the new law and to mitigate any unforeseen and adverse effects of a ban. The consultation process will start shortly and I urge as many of you to participate in it as possible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nExamining the changes in the industry\r\nDavid Cox was very eloquent on the tsunami of legislation coming in effect on the industry. Some of this he welcomed such as the forthcoming enhancement of banning order powers and the rogue agent database. Things like the stamp duty changes and the Section 24 tax changes to mortgage interest relieve could lead to a mass exodus from the buy to let market and make the lives of agents even more challenging. As with any predictions only time will tell what the real effects will be but watch this space.\r\n\r\nThe Keynote speaker was William Hague who in his now semi-detached role in the House of Lords gave an open and frank view of the political scene and the challenges we face in the future. He referred to a previous quote attributed to him when leader of the opposition that the Conservative Party only had two states, namely panic or complacency and this reflection of politics in general was both apt and poignant. It was refreshing to hear a former senior politician being so candid on the nature of politics.\r\n\r\nI was particularly encouraged by the announcement in the afternoon that following the publication of the working party\u2019s report and recommendations on Client Money Protection, that the Housing Minister had formally accepted the paper and that legislation would be brought into make the protection mandatory. This news brought loud applause.\r\nFollowers of my previous blogs will know that CMP is an issue I have closely followed and supported. As a redress scheme it has been frustrating that even when an agent has been found against, they have avoided paying their customers what they owe by either disappearing or folding up the company. CMP adds teeth to the other measured introduced to protect consumers and raise standards in the industry.\r\n\r\nARLA rightly should take the plaudits for campaigning for this commitment for a number of years, however I also want to point out that since we came into existence the Property Redress Scheme have been at the forefront of the pressure. Indeed it was the Chairman of my Advisory Council, Lord Monroe Palmer who at my behest jointly proposed the amendment to the Housing and Planning Act and with Baroness Diane Hayter chaired the working group and produced the report. Monroe, a skillful politician, persuaded the Government that the issue was about consumer protection and recompense rather than regulation and this was a subtle shift in the argument that made the difference to an administration by political philosophy is wary of red tape and institutional governance of free markets.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nPredicting how legislation will be enforced\r\nThe final entertainment of the day was a Judge Rinder style mock trial where it was speculated how a prosecution over the failure to comply with the Right to Rent legislation would go if an agent was taken to court following the discovery of an illegal immigrant in a property he let. The criminal proceedings for such an offence carries the penalty of a hefty fine and\/or a five year prison sentence. Following the \u201ctrial\u201d involving expert \u201cwitnesses\u201d sharing their legal opinion, the audience was asked whether they found the defendant guilty or not guilty. Surprisingly the verdict was 70% found him guilty and that a 5 year goal term appropriate. So much for trial by peers if you cannot be acquitted for an administrative oversight by your fellow agents! It demonstrates the importance of ensuring you are fully up to speed with the latest legislation and that you are not the first person to be prosecuted under this law.\r\nOverall the conference demonstrated the importance of taking note of the influence that politics will have on our sector over the next few years and beyond. The housing market is now firmly on the political agenda."],

Myself and a team made our way there for the day\u2019s events.\r\n\r\narla|propertymark boast that this was the largest conference they had ever held and in my view there was no mis-description here. Every seat was filled, indeed a sell-out. Given the political events surrounding the industry at the moment, I was frankly not surprised that so many flocked to this gathering especially as the agenda for the day promised to be eventful.\r\nThe main event\r\nWhat do you think dominated proceedings? Yes you have guessed it - the proposal to ban letting agent fees to tenants. This long standing debate has finally crystalised with the current Government\u2019s proposal to legislate on this issue and to follow Scotland with a prohibition enshrined in statute. Various statistics were presented on the impact of this change and the effect it will have on rents, agent\u2019s incomes and jobs and whether landlords would exit the market, flooding it with former buy-to- let properties. The arla|propertymark MD David Cox excoriated the Government as being heavy handed and out of touch with the sector and the effects their proposition would have. The pejoratives continued in a panel debate where David and a leading letting agent were pitted against a FT Journalist and Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town, a Labour Peer.\r\n\r\nFrom a neutral perspective, both sides made very valid points and the other member of the panel a civil servant from the ministry, clearly encouraged as many people as possible to feed into the consultation period. Whilst the conference was left with no doubt the ban would happen the how, when and the fine detail were all up for discussion and the industry should be as deeply involved as possible.\r\n\r\nThe current Housing Minister was notable by his absence but delegates were shown a recorded message predominantly focusing on the fees issue.\r\n\r\nUp to now, ARLA have been very bullish in their language and approach to the announcement and that in my view was the right thing for a trade body to do and their members should expect no less.\r\n\r\nThe Fair Fees Forum now presents a vehicle for presenting the industry perspective on the implementation of the new law and to mitigate any unforeseen and adverse effects of a ban. The consultation process will start shortly and I urge as many of you to participate in it as possible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nExamining the changes in the industry\r\nDavid Cox was very eloquent on the tsunami of legislation coming in effect on the industry. Some of this he welcomed such as the forthcoming enhancement of banning order powers and the rogue agent database. Things like the stamp duty changes and the Section 24 tax changes to mortgage interest relieve could lead to a mass exodus from the buy to let market and make the lives of agents even more challenging. As with any predictions only time will tell what the real effects will be but watch this space.\r\n\r\nThe Keynote speaker was William Hague who in his now semi-detached role in the House of Lords gave an open and frank view of the political scene and the challenges we face in the future. He referred to a previous quote attributed to him when leader of the opposition that the Conservative Party only had two states, namely panic or complacency and this reflection of politics in general was both apt and poignant. It was refreshing to hear a former senior politician being so candid on the nature of politics.\r\n\r\nI was particularly encouraged by the announcement in the afternoon that following the publication of the working party\u2019s report and recommendations on Client Money Protection, that the Housing Minister had formally accepted the paper and that legislation would be brought into make the protection mandatory. This news brought loud applause.\r\nFollowers of my previous blogs will know that CMP is an issue I have closely followed and supported. As a redress scheme it has been frustrating that even when an agent has been found against, they have avoided paying their customers what they owe by either disappearing or folding up the company. CMP adds teeth to the other measured introduced to protect consumers and raise standards in the industry.\r\n\r\nARLA rightly should take the plaudits for campaigning for this commitment for a number of years, however I also want to point out that since we came into existence the Property Redress Scheme have been at the forefront of the pressure. Indeed it was the Chairman of my Advisory Council, Lord Monroe Palmer who at my behest jointly proposed the amendment to the Housing and Planning Act and with Baroness Diane Hayter chaired the working group and produced the report. Monroe, a skillful politician, persuaded the Government that the issue was about consumer protection and recompense rather than regulation and this was a subtle shift in the argument that made the difference to an administration by political philosophy is wary of red tape and institutional governance of free markets.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nPredicting how legislation will be enforced\r\nThe final entertainment of the day was a Judge Rinder style mock trial where it was speculated how a prosecution over the failure to comply with the Right to Rent legislation would go if an agent was taken to court following the discovery of an illegal immigrant in a property he let. The criminal proceedings for such an offence carries the penalty of a hefty fine and\/or a five year prison sentence.

            "ev_short_description": ["The tax changes that began on 1 April 2017, and are phased over the next few years, are set to have a significant impact on landlords.\r\n\r\nOur guest blog is from our partner, the National Landlord Association, and explains these important changes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWho is affected?\r\nThe changes will affect all landlords with finance costs associated with letting their properties, although in this blog we refer primarily to\u00a0mortgage interest costs, because buy-to-let borrowing is the most prevalent source of finance in the sector.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat\u2019s changing?\r\nYou\u2019ve probably heard by now, but when calculating your taxable profit your ability to deduct finance costs from your rental income\/ turnover is being phased out over the next four years. Instead\u00a0you\u00a0will be able to claim just 20% of your finance costs as a tax reduction.\r\n\r\nUntil 6 April 2017 you were able to\u00a0deduct\u00a0your mortgage interest costs from your rental income before declaring your profit to the taxman. But by the time we reach the 2020-21 tax year you will no longer be able to do this.

            "ya_short_description": ["\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe newly rebranded arla|propertymark held its national conference in the ExCeL exhibition Centre in London\u2019s Docklands. Myself and a team made our way there for the day\u2019s events.\r\n\r\narla|propertymark boast that this was the largest conference they had ever held and in my view there was no mis-description here. Every seat was filled, indeed a sell-out. Given the political events surrounding the industry at the moment, I was frankly not surprised that so many flocked to this gathering especially as the agenda for the day promised to be eventful.\r\nThe main event\r\nWhat do you think dominated proceedings? Yes you have guessed it - the proposal to ban letting agent fees to tenants. This long standing debate has finally crystalised with the current Government\u2019s proposal to legislate on this issue and to follow Scotland with a prohibition enshrined in statute. Various statistics were presented on the impact of this change and the effect it will have on rents, agent\u2019s incomes and jobs and whether landlords would exit the market, flooding it with former buy-to- let properties. The arla|propertymark MD David Cox excoriated the Government as being heavy handed and out of touch with the sector and the effects their proposition would have. The pejoratives continued in a panel debate where David and a leading letting agent were pitted against a FT Journalist and Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town, a Labour Peer.\r\n\r\nFrom a neutral perspective, both sides made very valid points and the other member of the panel a civil servant from the ministry, clearly encouraged as many people as possible to feed into the consultation period. Whilst the conference was left with no doubt the ban would happen the how, when and the fine detail were all up for discussion and the industry should be as deeply involved as possible.\r\n\r\nThe current Housing Minister was notable by his absence but delegates were shown a recorded message predominantly focusing on the fees issue.\r\n\r\nUp to now, ARLA have been very bullish in their language and approach to the announcement and that in my view was the right thing for a trade body to do and their members should expect no less.\r\n\r\nThe Fair Fees Forum now presents a vehicle for presenting the industry perspective on the implementation of the new law and to mitigate any unforeseen and adverse effects of a ban. The consultation process will start shortly and I urge as many of you to participate in it as possible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nExamining the changes in the industry\r\nDavid Cox was very eloquent on the tsunami of legislation coming in effect on the industry. Some of this he welcomed such as the forthcoming enhancement of banning order powers and the rogue agent database. Things like the stamp duty changes and the Section 24 tax changes to mortgage interest relieve could lead to a mass exodus from the buy to let market and make the lives of agents even more challenging. As with any predictions only time will tell what the real effects will be but watch this space.\r\n\r\nThe Keynote speaker was William Hague who in his now semi-detached role in the House of Lords gave an open and frank view of the political scene and the challenges we face in the future. He referred to a previous quote attributed to him when leader of the opposition that the Conservative Party only had two states, namely panic or complacency and this reflection of politics in general was both apt and poignant. It was refreshing to hear a former senior politician being so candid on the nature of politics.\r\n\r\nI was particularly encouraged by the announcement in the afternoon that following the publication of the working party\u2019s report and recommendations on Client Money Protection, that the Housing Minister had formally accepted the paper and that legislation would be brought into make the protection mandatory. This news brought loud applause.\r\nFollowers of my previous blogs will know that CMP is an issue I have closely followed and supported. As a redress scheme it has been frustrating that even when an agent has been found against, they have avoided paying their customers what they owe by either disappearing or folding up the company. CMP adds teeth to the other measured introduced to protect consumers and raise standards in the industry.\r\n\r\nARLA rightly should take the plaudits for campaigning for this commitment for a number of years, however I also want to point out that since we came into existence the Property Redress Scheme have been at the forefront of the pressure. Indeed it was the Chairman of my Advisory Council, Lord Monroe Palmer who at my behest jointly proposed the amendment to the Housing and Planning Act and with Baroness Diane Hayter chaired the working group and produced the report. Monroe, a skillful politician, persuaded the Government that the issue was about consumer protection and recompense rather than regulation and this was a subtle shift in the argument that made the difference to an administration by political philosophy is wary of red tape and institutional governance of free markets.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nPredicting how legislation will be enforced\r\nThe final entertainment of the day was a Judge Rinder style mock trial where it was speculated how a prosecution over the failure to comply with the Right to Rent legislation would go if an agent was taken to court following the discovery of an illegal immigrant in a property he let. The criminal proceedings for such an offence carries the penalty of a hefty fine and\/or a five year prison sentence. Following the \u201ctrial\u201d involving expert \u201cwitnesses\u201d sharing their legal opinion, the audience was asked whether they found the defendant guilty or not guilty. Surprisingly the verdict was 70% found him guilty and that a 5 year goal term appropriate. So much for trial by peers if you cannot be acquitted for an administrative oversight by your fellow agents! It demonstrates the importance of ensuring you are fully up to speed with the latest legislation and that you are not the first person to be prosecuted under this law.\r\nOverall the conference demonstrated the importance of taking note of the influence that politics will have on our sector over the next few years and beyond. The housing market is now firmly on the political agenda."]

Myself and a team made our way there for the day\u2019s events.\r\n\r\narla|propertymark boast that this was the largest conference they had ever held and in my view there was no mis-description here. Every seat was filled, indeed a sell-out. Given the political events surrounding the industry at the moment, I was frankly not surprised that so many flocked to this gathering especially as the agenda for the day promised to be eventful.\r\nThe main event\r\nWhat do you think dominated proceedings? Yes you have guessed it - the proposal to ban letting agent fees to tenants. This long standing debate has finally crystalised with the current Government\u2019s proposal to legislate on this issue and to follow Scotland with a prohibition enshrined in statute. Various statistics were presented on the impact of this change and the effect it will have on rents, agent\u2019s incomes and jobs and whether landlords would exit the market, flooding it with former buy-to- let properties. The arla|propertymark MD David Cox excoriated the Government as being heavy handed and out of touch with the sector and the effects their proposition would have. The pejoratives continued in a panel debate where David and a leading letting agent were pitted against a FT Journalist and Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town, a Labour Peer.\r\n\r\nFrom a neutral perspective, both sides made very valid points and the other member of the panel a civil servant from the ministry, clearly encouraged as many people as possible to feed into the consultation period. Whilst the conference was left with no doubt the ban would happen the how, when and the fine detail were all up for discussion and the industry should be as deeply involved as possible.\r\n\r\nThe current Housing Minister was notable by his absence but delegates were shown a recorded message predominantly focusing on the fees issue.\r\n\r\nUp to now, ARLA have been very bullish in their language and approach to the announcement and that in my view was the right thing for a trade body to do and their members should expect no less.\r\n\r\nThe Fair Fees Forum now presents a vehicle for presenting the industry perspective on the implementation of the new law and to mitigate any unforeseen and adverse effects of a ban. The consultation process will start shortly and I urge as many of you to participate in it as possible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nExamining the changes in the industry\r\nDavid Cox was very eloquent on the tsunami of legislation coming in effect on the industry. Some of this he welcomed such as the forthcoming enhancement of banning order powers and the rogue agent database. Things like the stamp duty changes and the Section 24 tax changes to mortgage interest relieve could lead to a mass exodus from the buy to let market and make the lives of agents even more challenging. As with any predictions only time will tell what the real effects will be but watch this space.\r\n\r\nThe Keynote speaker was William Hague who in his now semi-detached role in the House of Lords gave an open and frank view of the political scene and the challenges we face in the future. He referred to a previous quote attributed to him when leader of the opposition that the Conservative Party only had two states, namely panic or complacency and this reflection of politics in general was both apt and poignant. It was refreshing to hear a former senior politician being so candid on the nature of politics.\r\n\r\nI was particularly encouraged by the announcement in the afternoon that following the publication of the working party\u2019s report and recommendations on Client Money Protection, that the Housing Minister had formally accepted the paper and that legislation would be brought into make the protection mandatory. This news brought loud applause.\r\nFollowers of my previous blogs will know that CMP is an issue I have closely followed and supported. As a redress scheme it has been frustrating that even when an agent has been found against, they have avoided paying their customers what they owe by either disappearing or folding up the company. CMP adds teeth to the other measured introduced to protect consumers and raise standards in the industry.\r\n\r\nARLA rightly should take the plaudits for campaigning for this commitment for a number of years, however I also want to point out that since we came into existence the Property Redress Scheme have been at the forefront of the pressure. Indeed it was the Chairman of my Advisory Council, Lord Monroe Palmer who at my behest jointly proposed the amendment to the Housing and Planning Act and with Baroness Diane Hayter chaired the working group and produced the report. Monroe, a skillful politician, persuaded the Government that the issue was about consumer protection and recompense rather than regulation and this was a subtle shift in the argument that made the difference to an administration by political philosophy is wary of red tape and institutional governance of free markets.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nPredicting how legislation will be enforced\r\nThe final entertainment of the day was a Judge Rinder style mock trial where it was speculated how a prosecution over the failure to comply with the Right to Rent legislation would go if an agent was taken to court following the discovery of an illegal immigrant in a property he let. The criminal proceedings for such an offence carries the penalty of a hefty fine and\/or a five year prison sentence. Following the \u201ctrial\u201d involving expert \u201cwitnesses\u201d sharing their legal opinion, the audience was asked whether they found the defendant guilty or not guilty. Surprisingly the verdict was 70% found him guilty and that a 5 year goal term appropriate. So much for trial by peers if you cannot be acquitted for an administrative oversight by your fellow agents! It demonstrates the importance of ensuring you are fully up to speed with the latest legislation and that you are not the first person to be prosecuted under this law.\r\nOverall the conference demonstrated the importance of taking note of the influence that politics will have on our sector over the next few years and beyond. The housing market is now firmly on the political agenda."],
            "ev_short_description": ["The tax changes that began on 1 April 2017, and are phased over the next few years, are set to have a significant impact on landlords.\r\n\r\nOur guest blog is from our partner, the National Landlord Association, and explains these important changes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWho is affected?\r\nThe changes will affect all landlords with finance costs associated with letting their properties, although in this blog we refer primarily to\u00a0mortgage interest costs, because buy-to-let borrowing is the most prevalent source of finance in the sector.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat\u2019s changing?\r\nYou\u2019ve probably heard by now, but when calculating your taxable profit your ability to deduct finance costs from your rental income\/ turnover is being phased out over the next four years. Instead\u00a0you\u00a0will be able to claim just 20% of your finance costs as a tax reduction.\r\n\r\nUntil 6 April 2017 you were able to\u00a0deduct\u00a0your mortgage interest costs from your rental income before declaring your profit to the taxman. But by the time we reach the 2020-21 tax year you will no longer be able to do this. Instead, you will receive a\u00a0tax\u00a0reduction\u00a0to your final tax bill, the equivalent of 20% of your mortgage interest costs \u2013 regardless whether you are a higher rate tax payer.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nAre the changes immediate?\u00a0\r\nThe changes aren\u2019t being introduced immediately, and will be phased in over the course of the next four years.\r\n\r\n \tYear 1: Current financial year (2017-18):\u00a0This year you can\u00a0deduct\u00a075% of your mortgage interest costs from your rental income before declaring your taxable profit. The remaining 25% of your mortgage interest will then be used to calculate a\u00a0tax\u00a0reduction\u00a0(equivalent to the basic rate of Income Tax of 20%) which is then applied to your final tax bill.\r\n \tYear 2: 2018-19:\u00a0Next year, the split will be 50% deduction and a 50% reduction.\r\n \tYear 3: 2019-20:\u00a0In year three the split will be 25% deduction and a 75% reduction.\r\n \tYear 4: 2020-21:\u00a0\u2026until finally, by year four you will no longer be able to\u00a0deduct\u00a0any of your mortgage interest costs and receive only the\u00a0tax reduction.\r\n\r\nThe NLA predicts that almost half a million landlords who currently pay the basic rate of tax\u00a0will be forced into a higher tax bracket\u00a0as a result.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat are my options?\r\nThere are a few options for landlords who will be hit by the changes:\r\n\r\n \tIncorporate: many landlords have taken this action already, but sadly the costs involved mean it isn\u2019t an option for everyone.\r\n \tRaise rents: faced with an increasing expense of providing housing many will have to raise rents in order to cover costs.\r\n \tSell up: Many landlords will not be able to absorb the increased costs and will need to sell. There\u2019s\u00a0already evidence of this happening.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nFurther changes announced by the government.\r\nIn addition, some sections of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which aim to crack down on \u201crogue\u201d landlords came into force this month (6 April).\r\n\r\nThe government also chose to publish the long-awaited consultation on an English letting fees ban.\r\n\r\nHere is a brief overview of what \u201crogue\u201d landlord measures came into force:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \tCivil Penalties\r\n\r\nCouncils are now able to impose fines of up to \u00a330,000 as an alternative to prosecution for a range of housing offences. They will be able to retain all of the income to make sure it is used for private sector housing enforcement purposes. They are not retrospective and cannot be imposed on offences committed before commencement.\r\n\r\nLocal housing authorities will be able to impose a civil penalty as an alternative to prosecution\r\n\r\nYou can read the Statutory Guidance for Civil Penalties here. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \tExtended Rent Repayment Orders\r\n\r\nRent repayment orders, which can be issued to penalise landlords managing or letting unlicensed properties, have also been extended to cover a wider range of situations.\r\n\r\nYou can read the Statutory Guidance for Rent Repayment Orders here.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"],
